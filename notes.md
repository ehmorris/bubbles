# TODO:

- De-OP the slingshot
  - There's a limit to how many bubbles a slingshot can pop
  - A slingshot gets smaller and slower as it pops bubbles
  - Faster slingshots pop more bubbles
  - Slow slingshots pop nothing
  - Once a slingshot is used up it pops

- Gameplay
  - Streaks: when popping bubbles in multiple consecutive gestures, show a message on-screen
  - Add a score feature: combos + streaks = multiplier
  - Some bubbles give a special bonus
  - After beating all levels, have the option (saved to localstorage) to play randomly generated levels to keep things interesting

- Better end-level and end-game screens
  - Some kind of replay or map?
  - Slo-mo replay of combos?
