# TODO:

- De-OP the slingshot
  - There's a limit to how many bubbles a slingshot can pop
  - Faster slingshots pop more bubbles
  - Slow slingshots pop nothing
  - Once a slingshot is used up it pops

- De-OP blasts
  - Blasts trigger automatically when they reach max size, like a grenade

- Better blast effects
  - Blasts apply a velocity to blasted balls. Direction of velocity is determined by angle from center of blast to center of popped ball.
