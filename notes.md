# TODO:

- De-OP the slingshot
  - There's a limit to how many bubbles a slingshot can pop
  - Faster slingshots pop more bubbles
  - Slow slingshots pop nothing
  - Once a slingshot is used up it pops

- Gameplay
  - Combos: when a slingshot or blast pops multiple bubbles, show a message on-screen
  - Streaks: when popping bubbles in multiple consecutive gestures, show a message on-screen
  - Add a score feature: combos + streaks = multiplier
  - Some bubbles give a special bonus

- Better end-level and end-game screens
  - Show level scores and cumulative end-game score
  - Show more concise taps / slingshots / blasts // popped / missed numbers
  - Some kind of replay or map?
  - Generate combo screencap that's sharable?
    - Could capture game state and save canvas to data url, put into image src attr
      - Canvas width/height
      - Balls + slingshots + blasts arrays
  - Slo-mo replay of combos?
